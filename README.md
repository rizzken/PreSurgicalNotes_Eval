# PreVisitPatientSummary-Eval

Quality evaluation of patient demographic summarization before primary care visit

## Project Overview

This project evaluates the quality of synthetic patient demographic data and tests the ability of generative AI models to create concise, structured summaries for physicians before a first-time patient visit.

**Goal**  
- Identify common data quality issues (missing values, invalid dates, duplicates, inconsistencies)  
- Assess LLM performance on summarization tasks (coverage, hallucinations, factual accuracy, formatting)  
- Highlight real-world limitations in using GenAI for medical data preparation

The project is inspired by a real primary care need: doctors require quick, accurate patient overviews before consultations.

## Skills & Tools Demonstrated

- Manual & exploratory testing  
- Data quality validation (missing values, duplicates, range/date checks, consistency)  
- Python + pandas for data analysis & visualization  
- Ollama for LLM summarization  
- Manual evaluation (coverage, hallucinations, factual checks)  
- GitHub + Google Colab for development & version control


## Phase 1: Data Quality Assessment

Tested on 115 synthetic patient records.

**Key Findings**  
- Dataset size: 115 rows, 28 columns  
- Highest missing values: suffix (99%), deathdate (87%), maiden (73%)  
- Duplicates: 2 full row duplicates  
- Unrealistic values: 6 negative records in income/expenses  
- Invalid dates: 5 future birthdates or illogical deathdates  
- Gender inconsistencies: multiple spellings detected  

**Not included in this phase**: Check for presence of at least one identification document (ssn, drivers, passport).  
(Planned for future iteration if ID becomes relevant for summarization.)

**Conclusion**: Even synthetic demographic data contains critical issues that must be addressed before LLM summarization.

**Artifacts**  
- `patients_with_age.csv` — dataset with calculated age column (for alive patients)

## Phase 2: LLM Summarization & Evaluation

**Models Evaluated**  
Several models were tested during the summarization experiments:
- Falconsai/medical_summarization (T5-based)
- google/flan-t5-large  
- Llama 3.1 8B (via Ollama) — selected as the primary model

Llama 3.1 8B showed the best overall performance, demonstrating superior structure adherence, better coverage of available fields, and higher consistency compared to the earlier models. Falconsai and Flan-T5 frequently failed to follow the required output format.
**Setup**  
- **Primary Model**: Llama 3.1 8B (via Ollama)  
- **Samples**: 10 synthetic patient profiles  
- **Approach**: Strict structured prompting + manual comparison against QA reference summaries

**Key Results**  
- Average score: 3.8/5  
- Hallucinations: 0%  
- Factual errors: 10% (mostly inherited from data issues)  
- Formatting inconsistency: 30% (e.g., inconsistent removal of appended digits from names)

**Conclusion**: The model shows high reliability (no hallucinations) and good coverage of available fields. Limitations primarily stem from input data quality. With data cleaning and prompt refinement, performance can reach 4.5+ consistently.

**Artifacts**  
- `patients_samples1.csv` — file with 10 randomly selected samples from the full list

## How to Run

1. Open notebooks in Google Colab  
2. Load data from the `data/` folder  
3. Run cells sequentially
